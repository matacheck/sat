Command clean
****************

Description
============

The **clean** command removes products in the *source, build, or install* directories of an application. Theses directories are usually named ``SOURCES, BUILD, INSTALL``.

Use the options to define what directories you want to suppress and to set the list of products.


Usage
=======

* Clean all previously created *build* and *install* directories (example application as *SALOME_xx*):

  .. code-block:: bash

    # take care, is long time to restore, sometimes
    sat clean SALOME-xx --build --install
    
* Clean previously created *build* and *install* directories, only for products with property *is_SALOME_module*:

  .. code-block:: bash

    sat clean SALOME-xxx --build --install \
                         --properties is_SALOME_module:yes
